Sun's Bane adds three new weapons to the game that are crafted with a new rare resource, Sun Shards, which can be rarely found in bastions or as an ore in the nether. These Sun Shards can be used to craft the Sun's Divine Longsword, which can be used to banish players to the sun and force them into a fight. Sun Shards can also be used to make the Sun's End (a better netherite sword) or the Awakened Sun's End which currently does not do much as of now. 

THIS MOD IS STILL IN BETA AND IS IN VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT 

(Also this code is written so badly papyrus would cook it for dinner)
